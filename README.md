### `tasks`
  You should create a React app to search for movies within the https://www.omdbapi.com/ database based on movie title(API key can be obtained for free).
  The app should have a search field, search button, and reset button
  The initial search results should display the 
  Poster image, 
  Title, 
  Release year, and
  Media type (Poster and title should be clickable and should lead to a detail page), and the button
    “Watch later”
  The initial search results should show the total number of results and also allow for pagination (10 films per page)
  The Detail page should contain all available information for the selected movie/series and a Back button which will lead back to the initial search result, and a button “Watch later”
  For the design of the app, you can use any library that you are comfortable with (bootstrap, foundation, ant design, etc.)
  We would like to view your progress on your repository of choice (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.)
  You can use any libraries from NPM.
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
